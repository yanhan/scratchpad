## Configuration

Create a file named `config`. This file should contain only 1 line with the AccuWeather API key.

To get an AccuWeather API key:

1. Go to https://developer.accuweather.com/ and sign up for free
2. Go to [My Apps](https://developer.accuweather.com/user/me/apps) and create a new app. Once done, you should be able to retrieve the API key for that app.
